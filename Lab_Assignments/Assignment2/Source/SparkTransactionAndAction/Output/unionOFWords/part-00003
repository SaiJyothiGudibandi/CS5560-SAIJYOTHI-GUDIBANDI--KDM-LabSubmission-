Cyprus has been a member of the EU since 2004. It sealed an EU bailout last month to save it from bankruptcy.

President Anastasiades said foreign investors who held deposits prior to 15 March, and who lost at least 3m euros would be eligible to apply for Cypriot citizenship.

Cyprus's existing "citizenship by investment" programme will also be revised to reduce the amount of investment required to be eligible from 10m euros to 3m.

The president said he would also drop requirements for citizenship applicants to keep 15m euros in Cypriot banks for five years, saying they would be allowed immediate access to their money.

"These decisions will be deployed in a fast-track manner," President Anastasiades said.

The Cypriot economy is worth about 18bn euros, which accounts for less than 0.2% of the eurozone total.
